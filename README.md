It is a Web Application is meant to be as a mock for Good Reads functionalities for developing and learning issues and not by any means violating copyrights. It has two views the admin and user views.

## Getting Started

These steps will get you a copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

## Installation

1.  Install  **Nodejs** _latest stable version_
2.  Install  **npm** _latest stable version_
3.  Install  **mongoDB v3.6.3**
4. _Optional Step_ â‡’ You can install **MongoDB Compass** [any user interface application for MongoDB] as it offers a user interface for dealing with the database
5.  Clone the Project
6.  **In Server Directory** 
	Run the following commands:
	```
	npm install
	cp .env.example .env
	cp config/auth.js.example config/auth.js
	mkdir logs
	mkdir -p public/upload/books
	mkdir -p public/upload/authors
	mkdir -p public/upload/users
	```
    
7. **In client Directory** 
	Run the following commands:
	```
	npm install
	cp .env.example .env
	mkdir -p public/books-covers
	mkdir -p public/authors-pics
	mkdir -p public/users-profile-pics
	```
9.  Create an empty database with named  **goodReadsDB**  in mongoDB [You can do so easily using MongoDB Compass or any user interface application for MongoDB].
10.  In the **Server/.env** file change the  `DB_HOST`,  `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD` and `DB_PORT`  variables to match the credentials of the database you just created. 
_You can optionally change other variables like `PORT` which is the port the Server is running on and other variable like `BOOKS_COVERS` or `REQUESTS_LOG` to match the paths you wish, but if there's no need for so we prefer to keep them as they are_
11. In the **client/.env** file, you change the  `PORT` _which is the port the Client is running on_ and  `REACT_APP_SERVER_PORT` _which is the port the Server is running on_
_If there's no need for so we prefer to keep them as they are unless you changed the value of `PORT` in Server/.env then you must change `REACT_APP_SERVER_PORT` to match its value_
    

## Usage

1. In the **Server** directory, run the following command to launch the Server in development mode:  `npm run dev`
Or you can start the Server using `npm start`
2. In the **client** directory, run the following command to launch the client:  `npm start`
